Comp 371 Assignment 3

This assignment is to save an image containing objects with a specific colour in a space with a light source. It uses ray
tracing to determine the colour of each pixel. 

Please note, I haven't had a chance to complete the assignment. I've been having some difficulty sending the rays and checking
its intersection. I believe that I got the rays to work. Now I have to check for the intersections by creating a function in
each object class that receives a ray and checks for the intersection. 

As of now, the execution of my program reads the text file (note, it only reads it and stores the line. I haven't continued the
class to extract its contents and object values) and creates an image with the width and height, assigns colours to the pixel
(the vec3 containing the colours will be replace eventually with a vector that contains the colours obtained from the rays), and
saves the image as a bmp. 

I'm submitting my assignment in the case that I won't have time to complete it before the late submission deadline. But, I plan
on working on it and resubmitting the assignment.
